### Keycloak Webhook Integration

The CRM automatically bootstraps the [p2-inc/keycloak-events](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-events) `ext-event-webhook` listener when you run `php artisan keycloak:create-realm`. To let Keycloak push events to the application you need to:

- Mount the `keycloak-events` provider JAR inside Keycloak (see [`keycloak-events` docs](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-events)).
- Set the webhook environment variables in `.env`:
  - `KEYCLOAK_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional, overrides the auto-generated `APP_URL` + `/api/keycloak/webhooks`)
  - `KEYCLOAK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (required, used both for Keycloak and to validate the `X-Keycloak-Signature` header)
  - `KEYCLOAK_WEBHOOK_EVENT_TYPES` (comma separated list or `*`)
  - `KEYCLOAK_WEBHOOK_ALGORITHM` (`HmacSHA256` by default)
- Ensure the CRM is reachable on `POST /api/keycloak/webhooks` so incoming events can be logged/processed.

When those variables are present, the realm sync will enable the listener, register/update the webhook, and Keycloak will start POSTing events to the Laravel endpoint where they are logged for further processing.
